# About the workshop

Do you want to improve the quality of your code and level up your software skills? If the answer is yes, this workshop is for you!

Code review is a software quality assurance activity where people check a program by viewing and reading parts of its source code. It is a wonderful opportunity to get immediate feedback on your code from your colleagues.

You will learn what the code review actually is, how to provide useful feedback, what are the most popular tools for performing reviews, and finally youâ€™ll have a chance to get feedback on your piece of code. The content will be delivered by experienced research software engineers and during practical sessions you will get guidance from our mentors.

# Who is it for?

For all academics with some coding experience (note that this is not a programming workshop).

We expect from you just 2 things

(a) basic programming experience;

(b) basic git familiarity.
