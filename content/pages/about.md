# About the workshop

Code review is a fantastic development practice that helps improving the quality, and the maintainability of a 
software project, whilst also fostering collaboration, and effective team work.
The concept of the Code review (a.k.a. [_Peer Code Review_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review)) is pretty simple: 
people (usually referred to as _reviewers_) read and check a software program by reading its source code in order to 
find possible defects, and to improve its overall quality.

Code Review is one of the pillars of [open source development](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews), and we 
believe that this should also be the case for **Research Software**. 

In this workshop we want to encourage the adoption of Code Review as a standard development practice for any researcher and practitioner who is interested in improving the quality of their code, and levelling up their software skills.

You will learn what Code review is, how it works, and what are some of the best practice to deliver it effectively. During the workshop, you will hear from experts and will work together with experienced Research Sofware Engineers in practical sessions to assess the quality of code snippets gathered from existing open research software.

# Who is it for?

For all academics with some coding experience (note that this is not a programming workshop).

We expect from you just 2 things

(a) basic programming experience;

(b) basic git familiarity.
